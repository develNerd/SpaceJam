/**
 * Interface implemented by a rendering class to allow it to drive a composable UI via an
 * appropriate [ComposeViewFactory] implementation, by simply overriding the [Content] method.
 * This is the compose analog to [AndroidViewRendering].
 *
 * Note that unlike most workflow view functions, [Content] does not take the rendering as a
 * parameter. Instead, the rendering is the receiver, i.e. the current value of `this`.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * @OptIn(WorkflowUiExperimentalApi::class)
 * data class HelloView(
 *   val message: String,
 *   val onClick: () -> Unit
 * ) : ComposeRendering {
 *
 *   @Composable override fun Content(viewEnvironment: ViewEnvironment) {
 *     Button(onClick) {
 *       Text(message)
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * This is the simplest way to bridge the gap between your workflows and the UI, but using it
 * requires your workflows code to reside in Android modules, instead of pure Kotlin. If this is a
 * problem, or you need more flexibility for any other reason, you can use [ViewRegistry] to bind
 * your renderings to [ComposeViewFactory] implementations at runtime.
